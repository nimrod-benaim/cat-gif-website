prometheus: 
  enabled: true  # Enable Prometheus monitoring. Setting this to true activates Prometheus within the chart.
  serviceMonitorSelector: {}  # Label selector for discovering external ServiceMonitor resources.
                             # An empty selector means Prometheus will consider all ServiceMonitors without filtering.
  serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false  
  # This setting prevents Helm from overriding the serviceMonitorSelector with its default values when the selector is nil.
  # It gives you control over the ServiceMonitor selection by ensuring that your specified (or empty) selector is used.
